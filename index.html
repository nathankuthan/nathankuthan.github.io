<h2>CONTRACT</h2>
<h2>Greetings to Everyone!!</h2>
<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>-Don't give up just because its difficult. The challenge is part of the story. You don't grow in comfort, you grow when things get tuff. Every time you push past resistance, you're building resilience. <strong>Success doesn't come from perfection, it comes from persistecne.</strong></p><br>
<p>-You might not be there yet, but that doesn't mean you're not on your way. <strong>Stay consistent.</strong> Stay hungry. Most importantly, believe in what you're working for, even on the days that feels out of reach. The payoff is coming.</p><br>
<p>-Every step forward counts, even when it's not quick, even when no one is watching. Hard work isn't flashy, and it doesn't always feel like progress.<strong>But every small effort add up. </strong> Every late night, every early morning, every time you choose to try again is what builds something real.</p><br>
